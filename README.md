## ImageSorter

This is a tool to sort through a lot of images at a time.

All you need to do is to open a folder full of images, and then press various keys on the keyboard to send the images to corresponding subfolders.

Once you press the key and the image is moved, you automatically get presented with the next image.

By default, there's only a preset for "spacebar" moving images to a subfolder called "NSFW" (the original purpose of this program was to simply sort out images of such character from piles of random images), but new keys are as easily added as needed, simply by pressing something on your keyboard that produces a character.

The "produces a character" part is more or less the only limitation - it can pretty much bind to anything that you can type in as one character (as long as it fits into UTF-16, I guess).

That means not only different actions for upper/lowercase, but also different alphabets, or even dead key entry methods such as umlauts.
